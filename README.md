# Top-5-workplace-related-injuries-in-the-US
The main aim of the project is to (1) find out the top 5 severe injuries reported by employers in the US., (2) which states have the highest counts of these severe injuries and (3) who are the employers reporting these highest counts of severe injuries.  P.S: As I am currently located in the state of Missouri, the injury statistics for that has been added as a bonus.
